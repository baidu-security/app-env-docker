/*

bWAPP, or a buggy web application, is a free and open source deliberately insecure web application.
It helps security enthusiasts, developers and students to discover and to prevent web vulnerabilities.
bWAPP covers all major known web vulnerabilities, including all risks from the OWASP Top 10 project!
It is for security-testing and educational purposes only.

Enjoy!

//   1. Change the IP address(es) in this file to the IP address(es) of your tool(s)
//   2. Point your web scanners, crawlers or attack tools to this URL: http://[bWAPP-IP]/bWAPP/aim.php
